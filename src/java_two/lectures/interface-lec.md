### Abstract class
    what is an abstract class?

    why?

    show demo: switch to the Employee example
        but make an employee name field w constructor and getters/setters

### Abstract methods
    what and why?

    show demo: work method
        Employee subclasses all do specific kinds of work

#### Enhance the demo
    make a Manager subclass with a different type of work

### Interfaces
    what and why?
        a way of allowing a non-related group of classes to share common BEHAVIOR

    maybe create an interface called LiftsHeavyThings
        require certain classes to implement liftHeavyThing()

        have 2 different classes do lifting a little differently 
            maybe ForkliftOperator uses a forklift, and a Manager orders someone else to do it

    maybe also have Employee implement Comparable?

    maybe show the default implementation?

### Helpful section: interfaces vs. abstract classes
    go thru this section and talk about each bullet
        be sure to mention problem with Abstract Class is single inheritance
