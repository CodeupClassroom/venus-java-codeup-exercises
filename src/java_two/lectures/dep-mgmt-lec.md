# Dependency Management

## Terms and questions
    What is a dependency?
        Internal AND External

    Are dependencies good or bad?
        What do we have to do if our code doesn't have any external dependencies?

## Build Tools
    Help us manage dependencies
        automatically check for version changes
        automatically downloads all dependencies for local execution
        smart compilation (only rebuilds the pieces it needs to rebuild)
    Also have some other neat features:
        customizeable plugins (supporting all kinds of dev features like code coverage checking, memory leak detection, etc.) 
        automated build process (compile, test, integrate, deploy, run, and different mixtures of these phases)

    For Java: Maven or Gradle

    Start a Maven project in IntelliJ (skip ahead)

    Now, explain the POM
