### Arrays
    important facts
        static size
        homogeneous element types

### Declaring
    how about an array of fruits?

### Initializing
    1. using "new"
        must know the size of the array
    2. using an array initializer
        must know all the elements up-front

### final
    what?!?!
    ok let's talk constants!

### Assigning values to elements
    what are initial values of elements?
        an array of ints
        an array of Strings
        an array of Persons

### Interating over an array
    for i
    for each
        print the elements in the array
        now is a good time for the toString method with Person!

### Arrays helper class
    fill
    equals 
        now MAY be a good time to override Person .equals
    copyOf
    toString
    sort

### Ignore 2D arrays

### How to change the size of an array?

### When to use arrays?
    when fixed size of elements is ok
    and/or when you know the values of all the elements up-front
        good use case: names of days of week, names of months
